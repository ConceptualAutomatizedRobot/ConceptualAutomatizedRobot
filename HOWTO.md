# Git policy

Always obey the following rule :

**Do not touch master ! Master should be the branch that should always work. Merge with it only, if everything is working.**

When initiating a new feature, create a branch named **<member name>-<feature name>** starting from master. Merge only once you have validated the feature with tests. If you need subbranches name the branch **<member name>-<feature name>-<subfeature name>**.
